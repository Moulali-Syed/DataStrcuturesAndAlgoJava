/*
Whenever we see a problem 
		first analyze it very well
		Second Think of the solution
		Third is pen down the solution
		Fourth is to write a code
		
One way to pen down is using FLOW CHARTS

Flow Charts:
Diagrammatic representation illustrating a solution to a problem
This allows you to break down any process into smaller steps and display them 
in a visually pleasing way

flow charts are very good for documenting 


Flow chart components:
Terminator - Start | End  --->(START)

Input/Output - Parallelogram 

Process - rectangle

Decision making -  rhombus

Connector - Arrow

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Example of flow chart:

1.Add two numbers

	start
	  |
	Read 2 numbers a,b --- parallelogram
	  |
	Add numbers  --- rectangle
	  |
	output sum --- parallelogram
	  |
	End


2.Read Principle , Time , Rate of Interest and calculate Simple Interest

		Start
		  |
	Read principle , time, rateOfInterest --- parallelogram 
	      |
	Calculate SI and store in simpleInterest principle,time,rateOfInterest SI=P*T*R/100 [Process-Rectangle box]
	      |
	output SI --- parallelogram
		  |
		End
