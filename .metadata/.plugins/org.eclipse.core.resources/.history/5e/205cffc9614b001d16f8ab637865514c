/*
In java we have stack memory and heap memory

Whatever local variables we are creating they go to stack, the function calls
we are making will also be in call stack

But in case of a non primitive
Suppose consider an array
int[] arr = new int[10];

this arr is not the actual array , actual array is created some where
this arr will hold the address of the array
the actual array is stored in heap , arr [reference variable ] will be stored in stack

Heap relatively big compared to Stack
