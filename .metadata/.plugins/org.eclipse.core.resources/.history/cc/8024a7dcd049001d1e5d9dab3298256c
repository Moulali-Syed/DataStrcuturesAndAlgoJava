/*
Binary Search is better than Linear Search
*** The condition for binary search is Array must be sorted *****
Binary Search can only work upon sorted array

Say we have an array 
	6 10 15 32 35 40 45 60
	0 1  2  3  4   5  6  7  --[index positions]
	
We will find the middle index
	midIndex = (startIndex+endInd)/2
	
Then we compare the search element , with element at midIndex
if they are equal then i found my answer

if not then we check whether the search element is greater than or less than midIndex element

if searchElement is greater , check to the right side , i.e from midIndex+1 to end
if searchElement is less , check from midIndex-1 i.e left side[start to midIndex-1]
