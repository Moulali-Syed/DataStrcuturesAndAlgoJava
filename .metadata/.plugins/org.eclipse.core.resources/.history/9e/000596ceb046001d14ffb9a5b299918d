/*
int i=10;

it will be stored in memory as binary number  1010

int has 4 bytes space - 32 bits
		0 0 0 0 0 ......1 0 1 0
		means remaining all bits will be stored as 0
		
 
 Assume i have 4 bits
 i can store 0000 to 1111
 that is i can store 0 to 15 in 4bits
 
 4 bits - 0 to (2^4) - 1
 if there are n bits we can store 0 to (2^n)-1
*/

/*

Lets have a proposal that we have 4 bits and first represent sign

	say 0 - in 1st bit represents positive number
	say 1 - in 1st bit represents negative number
	
	0
