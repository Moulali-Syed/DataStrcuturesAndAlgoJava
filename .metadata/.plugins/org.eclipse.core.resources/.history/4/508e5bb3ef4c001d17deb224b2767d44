say we have k+kn+kn^2+klogn

	we worry about for an input  n , which is highest operations happening
	as n increases - k1 doesnot 
	   n increases - kn increases
	   n increases = kn^2 increases rapidly
	   
	kn+kn^2+kn^3+kn^2logn
	we can say time complexity is n^3 - because rest are less compared to n^3
