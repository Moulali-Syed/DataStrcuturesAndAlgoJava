Java is platform Independent
Java is Object Oriented
MultiThreading
Memory Management - Garbage collection

Platform Independence:
Suppose i write a code 
c = a+b

But computer can understand only binary

our java code converts to binary by compiler
problem with c++ code
in .cpp we get a binary code which is not same for all OS, all platforms
executable file will not run on a different platform
compiled code is different for different machines


But in java
We get a .class file on compilation
Which can run on all the platforms
In java JVM is platform dependent that helps to converts this .class file
and run on any platform
